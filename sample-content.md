# Sample Blog Posts Content

Since we're using a database-driven approach with Prisma, I'll create a few sample blog posts in the database. This content would typically be entered via an admin interface, but for now, I'll create them directly in the database.

## Sample Posts:

1. **How to Install Homebrew on macOS** - Mac category
2. **Setting up VS Code for Web Development** - VS Code category
3. **Android Developer Options Guide** - Android category
4. **Windows Terminal Setup and Customization** - Windows category
5. **Google Drive Organization Tips** - Google Tools category

These posts will help test the blog functionality and demonstrate the categories system.
