## The PARA Method for Google Drive

The PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) is perfect for Drive organization:

<StepList>
  <Step number={1} title="Set Up Main Folder Structure">
    Create these four top-level folders:

    ```
    📁 01 - Projects
    📁 02 - Areas
    📁 03 - Resources
    📁 04 - Archive
    ```

    <ProTip>
      Use numbers to force alphabetical sorting and ensure consistent folder order across all devices.
    </ProTip>

    ### Folder Definitions

    <CardGrid columns={2}>
      <Card title="Projects">
        Specific outcomes with deadlines:
        - Client work
        - Events planning
        - Product launches
        - Research projects
      </Card>

      <Card title="Areas">
        Ongoing responsibilities:
        - Finance management
        - Health records
        - Home maintenance
        - Professional development
      </Card>
    </CardGrid>

    <CardGrid columns={2}>
      <Card title="Resources">
        Future reference materials:
        - Templates
        - Inspiration
        - How-to guides
        - Industry research
      </Card>

      <Card title="Archive">
        Inactive items from other categories:
        - Completed projects
        - Old area materials
        - Outdated resources
      </Card>
    </CardGrid>

  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Create Project Subfolders">
    Within the Projects folder, organize by status and timeline:

    ```
    📁 01 - Projects
      📁 Active Projects
        📁 2025-01 Website Redesign
        📁 2025-02 Marketing Campaign

        📁 2025-Q2 Conference
    ```

    ### Project Naming Convention
    ```
    YYYY-MM Project Name
    ```

    This ensures chronological sorting and easy identification.

  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Organize Areas by Life/Work Domains">
    Structure areas by major life categories:

    ```
    📁 02 - Areas
      📁 Work

        📁 Hobbies
        📁 Family
    ```

  </Step>
</StepList>

## Advanced Folder Strategies

### Color-Coding System

Use Google Drive's color-coding feature strategically:

<CardGrid columns={2}>
  <Card title="Priority Colors">
    - **Red**: Urgent/High Priority
    - **Orange**: Important/Medium Priority
    - **Yellow**: Standard/Low Priority
    - **Green**: Completed/Reference
  </Card>

  <Card title="Category Colors">
    - **Blue**: Work-related
    - **Purple**: Personal
    - **Gray**: Archive/Inactive
    - **Pink**: Shared/Collaborative
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### File Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming patterns:

#### Documents

```
YYYY-MM-DD_Document-Type_Brief-Description_v##

Examples:
2025-01-15_Report_Q4-Sales-Analysis_v01
2025-01-20_Contract_ABC-Company-Agreement_v03
2025-01-25_Proposal_Website-Redesign_Final
```

#### Images and Media

```
YYYY-MM-DD_Event-or-Project_Description_Photographer

Examples:
2025-01-15_Team-Meeting_Action-Items_Screenshot
2025-01-20_Product-Launch_Hero-Image_JohnDoe
2025-01-25_Conference_Presentation-Slides_v02
```

### Version Control Strategy

<ImportantNote>
  Google Drive automatically tracks versions, but clear naming helps identify
  the latest version quickly.
</ImportantNote>

#### Version Naming System

```
v01, v02, v03... (for drafts)
Final (for completed versions)
APPROVED (for officially signed-off documents)
```

#### Alternative: Date-Based Versions

```
YYYY-MM-DD (date of creation/major revision)
```

## Security and Privacy Best Practices

### File Sharing Security

<ErrorTip>

3. **Editor**: Can edit, comment, and share
4. **Owner**: Full control (cannot be shared)

#### Best Practices

- **Review sharing regularly**: Audit who has access
- **Use expiration dates**: Set time limits on shared links
- **Require sign-in**: For sensitive documents
- **Track link usage**: Monitor access with link analytics

### Data Protection Strategies

#### Backup Critical Files

```
Local Backup Strategy:
1. Download important files monthly
2. Use Google Takeout for complete exports
3. Maintain copies of legal documents
4. Consider additional cloud backup services
```

#### Access Control

- **Two-factor authentication**: Enable on Google account
- **Regular security checkups**: Review Google security settings
